# ISSATSo University IHM Project

## Overview

The ISSATSo University IHM project aims to transform university life by enhancing accessibility and user experience through carefully designed interfaces for both the institute's website and mobile application. Here's an overview of the main aspects of our approach:

## Ergonomic Design:

- We implement ergonomic rules to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Primary colors, chosen in shades of blue and yellow, promote readability and are particularly suitable for users with vision impairments.

## Accessibility:

- Calm and productive colors are used to ensure optimal visibility and a pleasant experience for all users.
- Alignment and uniformity of elements ensure a consistent and easy-to-use visual interface.

## Integration of AI for Attendance Management:

- An AI engine is integrated to automate the recording of student and teacher absences.
- GPS tracking is used to automatically record student presence in specific areas, providing an efficient and transparent solution.

## Gamification of the Solution:

- Integration of a gamification system with quizzes offered by professors.
- Students can earn bonus points by correctly answering quizzes, creating a motivating scoring system.

## Clear Iconography:

- Clear and visible icons are used to facilitate access to different interface functionalities.
